Default styles for radio buttons and checkboxes can be used.

### **The form consists of the following elements:**

1. **Task addition area**: 
   - An input field and an "Add" button.
2. **Task list area**: 
   - A list of tasks with checkboxes for completion and icons for deleting tasks.
3. **Task status filter**: 
   - A group of radio buttons for filtering tasks by status: All/Active/Completed. The default is "All."
4. **Task sorting field**: 
   - A dropdown menu with two options: "Name" and "Status." The default is "Name."

### **Additional Conditions:**

1. Manage the list state using **react-redux** or **redux toolkit (RTK)**.
2. Configure button styles for the "Add" button:
   - On hover, the button's color should lighten.
   - On click (action), the button's color should darken.
3. Use **TypeScript** to type constants/variables.
4. Host the project on GitHub in your personal account.
